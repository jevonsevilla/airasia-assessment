# airasia-assessment
In partial completion of my application to airasia

## usage
the folders `task 1` and `task 2` contain my answers to the corresponding parts of the assessment.  
  
`task 1`: comprised of individual sql files that answer each question
`task 2`: comprised of a notebook and supporting assets that were needed to model the problem. Answers to questions can be found in the notebook written in markdown.
